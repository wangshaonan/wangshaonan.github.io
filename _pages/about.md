I am an Associate Professor at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. I have been working as a Research Associate at the Neuroscience of Language Lab (NelLLab) at NYU working with Prof. Liina Pylkk√§nen since 2021. In June 2018, I received my PhD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), supervised by Prof. Chengqing Zong. Before this, I received my BS degree from Northeastern University in June 2013.

My research focuses on 1) combining insights of cognitive psychology to build better natural language understanding models. I am interested in how to represent the meaning of language symbols, such as words phrases, and sentences; How to make the language model learn as efficiently as people; How to evaluate the performance of a computational model; etc. 2) Applying computational linguistic methods in studying psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience researches. Currently, I use computational methods to study human language representation and sequence learning. I am interested in how humans represent and store semantic concepts; how humans combine words to form more complex meanings of sentences; How humans learn and generalize from few examples; etc.
