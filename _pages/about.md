I am an **Associate Professor** at the **Institute of Automation**, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China. From November 2021 to November 2023, I served as a Research Associate at the Neuroscience of Language Lab (NelLLab) at NYU, collaborating with **Prof. Liina PylkkÃ¤nen**. I completed my PhD in June 2018 at the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), CASIA, under the guidance of **Prof. Chengqing Zong**. My academic journey began with a BS degree from Northeastern University in June 2013.

### **Research Interests**

**Natural Language Understanding Inspired by the Brain**  
 - Representing the meaning of linguistic symbols, including words, phrases, and sentences.
 - Exploring how language models can learn as efficiently as humans.
 - Evaluating the performance of computational models in language processing tasks.

**Computational Method in Psych and Neuro Linguistic Questions**  
 - Investigate human language representation and composition mechanisms.
 - Understand how humans represent and store semantic concepts, combine words to form complex sentence meanings, and generalize from limited examples.
 - Develop brain-computer interface systems.

### âœ¨ **Latest News** âœ¨

I am thrilled to announce that **Jixing** and I will be hosting a symposium at **SNL 2024** titled "[Modeling linguistic processes through experimental and naturalistic designs](https://www.neurolang.org/2024/symposia/?id=5)." ðŸŒŸ Our invited speakers include **Nai Ding, Yanchao Bi, Yohei Oseki, Ping Li, Alona Fyshe,** and **Jixing Li**. We will explore the benefits and challenges of using controlled versus naturalistic stimuli and discuss the potential of computational models to deepen our understanding of linguistic processes in the human brain. Don't miss outâ€”see you in **Bristan** on **October 24**! ðŸŽ‰
