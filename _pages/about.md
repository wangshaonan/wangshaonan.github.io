I am now an Assistant Professor at the institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.  In June 2018, I received my PHD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), supervised by Prof. Chengqing Zong. Prior to this, I received my BS degree from Northeastern University in June 2013.

My research interests are natural language understanding, including textual semantic analysis, representation learning, human language understanding.

# News

- One paper "Towards Sentence-Level Brain Decoding with Distributed Representations" have been accepted by AAAI2019!

- (24/5/2018) Successfully defended my PHD thesis "Learning Vector representations for Words, Phrases and Sentences".
